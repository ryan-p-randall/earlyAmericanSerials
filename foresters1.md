THE FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of* JOHN BULL, *the  
Clothier.*  
EVERY one who has read the  
history of *John Bull*, the  
clothier, must have observed, that  
though “he was in the main an ho-  
nest, plain dealing fellow, yet he  
was choleric and inconstant, and ve-  
ry apt to quarrel with his best  
friends.” This observation we shall  
find fully verified in the course of  
the following narrative; and as the  
opinions and manners of superiors  
have a very great influence in form-  
ing the character of inferiors, we  
need not be surprized if we find a  
family likeness prevailing among the  
persons whose history we are about  
to recite, most, of whom were form-  
erly residents in Mr. Bull’s house,  
or apprentices in his shop.  
There was among the appen-  
dages to John’s estate, a pretty large  
tract of land, which had been ne-  
glected by his ancestors, and which  
he never cared much about, except-  
ing that now and then some of his  
family went thither a-hunting, and  
brought home venison and furs. In-  
deed this was as far as I can find the  
best pretence that John had to call  
the land his; for he had no legal  
title to it. It was then a very woody  
country, in some parts rocky and  
hilly, in other parts level; well wa-  
tered with brooks and ponds, and  
the whole of it bordered on a large  
lake, in which were plenty of fish,  
some of which were often served up  
at John’s table, on fast-days.  
The stories told by one and an-  
other of these adventurers, had made  
a deep impression on the mind of   
*Walter Pipe-Weed* ([^1] ) one of John’s  
domestics, a fellow of a roving and  
projecting disposition, and who had  
learned the art of surveying. Walter  
having frequently listened to their  
chat, began to think within him-  
self, “If these fellows make so ma-  
ny pence by their excursions to this  
wild spot, what might not I gain  
by sitting down upon it ? There is  
plenty of game and fish at hand, for  
a present supply; plenty of nuts  
and acorns to fatten pigs, and with  
some small labour I may be able  
to raise corn and feed poultry, which  
will fetch me a good price at mar-  
ket.—I can carry bisket enough in  
my pockets, to keep me alive till my  
first crop comes in, and my dog can  
live upon the offals of the game that  
I shall kill.—Besides, who knows  
what treasures the land itself may  
contain—perhaps some rich mines !  
—od zounds!—then I am made for  
this world.”  
Full of this dream, Walter ap-  
plied to his master one day for a  
lease of part of *the forest*, as it was  
called. Bull at first laughed at the  
proposal, and put him off; but Wal-  
ter followed it up so close, and told  
what advantages might be gained  
by settling there, and promised, if  
he should succeed, to turn all his  
trade into his master’s hand, and  
give him the refusal of whatever he  
might bring to market, and withal  
shewed him some draughts, which  
he had made with chalk, from the  
reports of the huntsmen, that Bull  
began to think of the matter in good  
earnest, and consulted his lawyer  
upon the subject, who, after due  
consideration of the premises, and  
stroking his band, advised him as  
follows. “Why yes, Mr. Bull, I  
don’t see why you ought not to  
look about you as well as your neigh-  
bours. There is *Lord Street*—he  
has a large manor adjoining to your  
forest, which, they say, yields him a  
fine rent, and, who knows, but this  
may bring you in as much, or more?  
—Then there is old *Lewis*, the cud-  
gel-player, and *Nic Frog*, the dra-  
per, who have, perhaps, (I say *per- *  
*haps*, Mr. Bull, because it may be  
a little doubtful on both sides, and  
in that case, you know, sir, it would  
not become gentlemen of our cloth,  
to speak positively) as good a claim  
as your honor to this land; but then  
it is a maxim, you know, that pos-  
session is eleven points of the law,  
and if you once get your foot upon  
it—they can not out you without a  
process, and your honor knows that  
your purse is as long as theirs, and  
you are as able to stand a suit with  
them as they are with you. I there-  
fore advise you to humour your man  
Walter, and give him a lease, and a  
pretty large one—you may find  
more advantages in it than you are  
aware of—but lease it, lease it at any  
rate.” Upon this he was ordered  
to make out a lease; and Walter be-  
ing thus invested with as good au-  
thority as could be obtained, filled  
his pockets with bread and cheese,  
took his gun, powder-flask, and shot  
of various kinds, with a parcel of  
fishing-lines and hooks, his survey-  
ing instruments, and a bag of corn  
on his shoulders, and off he trotted  
to his new paradise.  
It was some time before he could  
fix upon a spot to his liking, and he  
at first met with some opposition  
from the bears and wolves, and was  
greatly exposed to the weather,  
before he could build him a hut;  
once or twice the savage animals had  
almost devoured him, but being  
made of good stuff, he stood his  
ground, cleared a little spot, put his  
seed into the earth, and lived as well  
as such adventurers can expect, poor-  
ly enough at first, but supported by  
the hope of better times. After a  
while he began to thrive, and his  
master Bull recommended a *wife* ([^2])  
to whom he married, and by whom  
he had a number of children. Hav-  
ing found a new sort of grain in the  
forest, and a certain plant of a nar-  
cotic quality, he cultivated both,  
and having procured a number of  
([^3]) *black-cattle*, he went on pretty  
gaily in the planting way, and  
brought his narcotic weed into great  
repute, by sending a present of a  
quantity of it to his old master, who  
grew excessively fond of it, and kept  
calling for more, till he got the  
whole trade of it into his own hands,  
and sold it out of his own ware-house  
to old Lewis, Nic Frog, and all the  
other tradesmen around him. In  
return he supplied Walter with  
cloths and stuffs for his family, and  
utensils for his husbandry; and as  
a reward for being the first, who had  
courage to make a settlement in his  
forest, and in token of his high es-  
teem of him as a customer, as well as  
for certain other reasons, he made  
it a practice every year, to present  
him with a waggon-load of ordure,   
([^4]) the sweepings of his back-yard,  
the scrapings of his dog-kennel, and  
contents of his own water closet.  
This was a mark of politeness which  
John valued himself much upon. “It  
may seem odd (said he one day to a  
friend) that I make such a kind of  
compliment as this to my good cus-  
tomer; but if you consider it a-  
right you will find it a piece of re-  
fined policy—for by this means I  
get rid of a deal of trash and rub-  
bish that is necessarily made in such  
a family as mine; I get a cursed  
stink removed from under my nose,  
and my good friend has the advan-  
tage of it upon his farm, to manure  
his grounds, and make them produce  
more plentifully that precious weed  
in which we all so much delight.”  
Walter was often seen, on the arri-  
val of Bull’s waggon, to clap his  
handkerchief to his nose; but as he  
knew his old master was an odd sort  
of a fellow, and it was his interest  
to keep in with him, he generally  
turned off the compliment with a  
laugh, saying, good naturedly e-  
nough, “Let him laugh that wins,”  
without explaining his meaning, tho’  
it might admit of a *double entendre*,  
—and calling some of his servants,  
he ordered them to shovel out the  
dung, and make his black cattle mix  
theirs with it—and when spread over  
the land, the air took out most of  
the scent, and the salts were of some  
advantage to the soil.  
After Walter Pipe-weed had got  
his affairs into tolerable order, he  
was visited in his retirement by   
*Frederick Peterson* ([^5]), another of  
Bull’s apprentices, who had taken  
a fancy to the same kind of life,  
from a disgust to some things that  
had happened in the family. He  
had not been long with Walter be-  
fore he found it would not do for  
him to remain there. Frederick  
was supposed to be a natural son of  
old *Lord Peter*, after whom he was  
nick-named. He had the same af-  
fected airs, and a tincture of the  
high flying notions of his reputed fa-  
ther. These made him rather dis-  
gustful to Walter, who had learned  
his manners of Mr. Bull’s mother,  
when she was in her sober senses,  
and between her and Lord Peter  
there had been a long variance.  
When Frederick perceived that his  
company was not desired, he had so  
much good sense as to leave Walter’s  
plantation, and paddling across a  
creek, seated himself on a point of  
land that ran out into the lake. Of  
this he obtained a lease of his old  
master, and went to work in the  
same manner as Walter had done,  
who, liking his company best at a  
distance, was willing to supply him  
with bread and meat till he could  
scramble for himself. Here he took  
to husbandry, raising corn and the  
narcotic weed, and buying up *black *  
*cattle*, and after a while turned his  
produce into his old master’s ware-  
house, and received from him the  
annual compliment of a waggon-  
load of dung, excepting that when  
there had not been so much as usual  
made, he and Walter were to share  
a load between them.  
To ingratiate himself still farther  
with his old master, he accepted of  
a girl out of his family for a wife,  
(for John was always fond of his  
tenants marrying for fear of their  
doing worse) he took as little notice  
as possible of his reputed father, and  
dropping, or disowning his nick-  
name of Peterson, he assumed that of   
*Marygold*, which old Madam Bull  
understood as a compliment to one  
of her daughters.—He also made  
his court to the old lady by kneel-  
ing down and kissing the fringe of  
her embroidered petticoat, as was  
the fashion of that day. This cere-  
mony, tho’ a trifle in itself, helped  
much to recommend him to Mr.  
Bull, who was a very dutiful son,  
and took his mother’s advice in most  
parts of his business. In short, Fre-  
derick was too much of a politician  
to suppose that filial affection ought  
to stand in the way of a man’s inte-  
rest, and in this he judged as most  
other men would have done in the  
same circumstances.

JOHN BULL, *the Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from Page 456.*\]  
ABOUT the time in which  
these first attempts were mak-  
ing, and the fame of them had  
raised much jealousy among some,  
and much expectation among others,  
there happened a sad quarrel in John  
Bull’s family. His mother, ([^6]) poor  
Woman, had been seized with hyste-  
ric fits, which caused her at times  
to be delirious and full of all sorts  
of whims. She had taken it into  
her head that every one of the fa-  
mily must hold knife and fork and  
spoon exactly alike; that they must  
all wash their hands and face pre-  
cisely in the same manner; that  
they must sit, stand, walk, kneel,  
bow, spit, blow their noses, and  
perform every other animal function  
by the exact rule of *uniformity*,  
which she had drawn up with her  
own hand, and from which they  
were not allowed to vary one hair’s  
breadth. If any one of the family  
complained of a lame ancle or stiff  
knee, or had the crick in his neck,  
or happened to cut his finger, or  
was any other way so disabled as not  
to perform his duty to a tittle, she  
was so far from making the least al-  
lowance, that she would frown and  
scold and rave like a bedlamite; and  
John was such an obedient son to his  
mother, that he would lend her his  
hand to cut their ears, or his foot  
to kick their backsides, for not com-  
plying with her humours. This  
way of proceeding raised an uproar  
in the family; for though most of  
them complied, either through af-  
fection for the old lady, or through  
fear, or some other motive, yet  
others looked sour, and grumbled;  
some would openly find fault and  
attempt to remonstrate, but they  
were answered with a kick or a  
thump, or a cat-o’nine tails, or shut  
up in a dark garret ‘till they pro-  
mised a compliance. Such was the  
logic of the family in those days!  
Among the number of the disaf-  
fected, was PEREGRINE PICKLE, ([^7])   
a pretty honest, clever sort of a fel-  
low about his business, but a great  
lover of sour crout, and of an hu-  
mour that would not bear con-  
tradiction. However, as he knew  
it would be fruitless to enter into  
a downright quarrel, and yet he  
could not live there in peace; he  
had so much prudence as to quit the  
house, which he did by getting out  
of the window in the night. Not  
liking to be out of employ, he went  
to the house of NIC. FROG, ([^8])   
his master’s old friend and rival, told  
him the story of his sufferings, and  
got leave to employ himself in one  
of his garrets ‘till the storm should  
be over. After he had been here  
a while, he thought Nick’s family  
were as much too loose in their man-  
ners as Bull’s were too strict; and  
having heard a rumour of the Forest,  
to which Nick had some kind of  
claim, he packed up his little all,  
and hired one of Nick’s servants  
who had been there a hunting, to  
pilot him to that part of the Forest  
to which Nick laid claim. But  
Frog had laid an anchor to wind-  
ward of him; for as Pickle had  
said nothing to him about a lease,  
he supposed that when Peregrine  
had got into the Forest he would  
take a lease of his old master, Bull,  
which would strengthen his title,  
and weaken his own; he therefore  
bribed the pilot to shew Peregrine  
to a barren part of the Forest instead  
of that fertile place ([^9]) to which he  
had already sent his surveyors, and  
of which he was contriving to get  
possession. Accordingly the pilot  
having conducted Pickle to a sandy  
point which runs into the lake, ([^10])  
it being the dusk of the evening, ([^11])   
bade him good night, and walked  
off. Peregrine, who was fatigued  
with his march, laid down and went  
to sleep, but waking in the morning,  
saw himself alone in a very dreary  
situation, where he could get no-  
thing to live upon but clams, and a  
few acorns which the squirrels had  
left. In this piteous plight the poor  
fellow folded his arms, and walking  
along the sandy beach, fell into such  
a soliloquy as this. “So much for  
travelling! Abused by Bull, cheat-  
ed by Frog, what am I at last come  
to? Here I am alone, no creatures  
but bears, and wolves, and such  
vermin around me! Nothing in the  
shape of an human being that I  
know of, nearer than Pipeweed’s  
plantation, and with him I cannot  
agree, he is so devoted to old Dame  
Bull that he and I cannot live toge-  
ther any more than I could with the  
old woman. But, why should I  
despair? That is unmanly; there  
is at least a *possibility* of my living  
here, and if I am disappointed in  
my worldly prospects, it is but  
right, for I professed not to have  
any. My wish was to have my  
own way without disturbance or  
contradiction, and surely I can here  
enjoy my liberty. I have nobody  
here to curse me, or kick me, or  
cheat me. If I have only clams to  
eat, I can cook them my own way,  
and say as long a grace over them as  
I please. I can sit or stand, or kneel,  
or use any other posture at my de-  
votions, without any cross old wo-  
man to growl at me, or any hector-  
ing bully to cuff me for it. So that  
if I have lost in one way I have  
gained in another. I had better  
therefore reconcile myself to my si-  
tuation and make the best of a bad  
market. But company is good!  
Apropos! I will write to some of  
my fellow-prentices; I know they  
were as discontented as myself in  
old Bull’s family, though they did  
not care to speak their minds as  
plainly as I did. I’ll tell them how  
much happiness I enjoy here in my  
solitude. I’ll point out to them the  
charms of liberty, and coax them  
to follow me into the wilderness;  
and by and by, when we get all to-  
gether, we shall make a brave hand  
of it.” Full of this resolution, he  
sat down on a windfallen tree, and  
pulling out his inkhorn and paper,  
wrote a letter to JOHN CODLINE,  
HUMPHRY PLOUGHSHARE, and  
ROGER CARRIER, three of his fel-  
low-apprentices, informing them of  
the extreme happiness he enjoyed in  
having liberty to eat his scanty meals  
in his own way, and to lay his swell-  
ed ancles and stiff knee in whatever  
posture was most easy to him, con-  
juring them by their former friend-  
ship, to come to join them in car-  
rying on the good work so happily  
begun, &c. &c. As soon as he had  
finished the letter, (which had deep-  
ly engaged his attention) a hunts-  
man happened to come along in  
quest of game. This was a lucky  
circumstance indeed, for Peregrine  
had not once thought of a convey-  
ance for his letter; it proved also  
favourable to him in another view,  
for the huntsman taking pity on his  
forlorn situation, spared him some  
powder and shot and a few biscuit  
which he happened to have in his  
pocket; so taking charge of the  
letter, he delivered it as it was  
directed.  
This letter arrived in good sea-  
son, for Old Madam had grown  
much worse since Pickle had left  
the family : her vapours had in-  
creased, and her longings and aver-  
sions were much stronger. She had  
a strange lurch for embroidered pet-  
ticoats and high waving plumes;  
her Christmas pies must have double  
the quantity of spice that was us-  
ual; the servants must make three  
bows where they formerly made but  
one, and they must never come into  
her presence without having curled  
and powdered their hair in the pink  
of the mode, for she had an aversion  
to every thing plain, and an high  
relish for every thing gaudy. Be-  
sides, she had retained an high met-  
tled chaplain ([^12]) who was constant-  
ly at her elbow, and said prayers  
night and morning in a brocaded  
vest with a gilded mitre on his  
head; and he exacted so many bows  
and scrapes of every one in the fa-  
mily, that it would have puzzled a  
French dancing master to have kept  
pace with him. Nor would he per-  
form the service at all unless a ver-  
ger stood by him all the while with  
a yard-wand in his hand; and if  
any servant or apprentice missed one  
bow or scrape, or made it at the  
wrong time, or dared to look off  
his book, or said Amen in the wrong  
place, rap went the stick over his  
head and ears or nuckles. It was in  
vain to appeal from the chaplain or  
the old Dame to their master, for  
he was so obedient a son that he  
suffered them to govern him as they  
pleased; nay, though broad hints  
were given that the chaplain was an  
emissary of lord Peter ([^13]) and was  
taking advantage of the old lady’s  
hysterics to bring the whole family  
into his interest, John gave no heed  
to any of these insinuations.  
As soon as the letter of Pere-  
grine Pickle arrived, the apprenti-  
ces, to whom it was directed, held a  
consultation what they should do.  
They were heartily tired of the con-  
duct of the chaplain; they lament-  
ed the old lady’s ill health, and  
wished for a cure; but there was at  
present no hope of it, and there-  
fore concluded that it was best to  
follow Pickle’s advice, and retire  
with him into the Forest. Though  
they were infected with the spirit of  
adventure, yet they were a set of  
wary fellows, and knew they could  
not with safety venture thither un-  
less they had a lease of the land.  
Happily, however, for them, Bull  
had a little while before that put the  
affairs of the Forest into the hands  
of a gentleman of the law, ([^14]) with  
orders to see that the matter was  
properly managed so as to yield him  
some certain profit. To this sage  
they applied, and for the proper  
fees, which they clubbed for be-  
tween them, they obtained a lease,  
under hand and seal; wherein, for  
“sundry causes him thereunto mov-  
ing, the said Bull did grant and  
convey unto John Codline and his  
associates, so many acres of his Fo-  
rest, bounded so and so, and which  
they were to have, hold, and enjoy  
for ever and ever and the day after,  
yielding and paying so and so, and  
so forth.” When this grand point  
was gained by the assistance of the  
lawyer and *his clerks*, who knew  
how to manage business: they sold  
all their superfluities to the pawn-  
brokers, and got together what  
things they supposed they should  
want, and leaving behind them a  
note on the compter, ([^15]) to tell their  
master where they were bound and  
what were their designs : they set  
off all together and got safe into a  
part of the Forest adjoining to  
Pickle, who hearing of their arrival,  
took his oaken staff in his hand and  
hobbled along as fast as his lame  
legs could carry him to see them, and  
a joyful meeting indeed they had.  
Having laid their heads together, it  
was agreed that Codline should send  
for a girl whom he had courted, ([^16])  
and marry her, and that he should  
be considered as the lord of the  
manor, that Pickle should have a  
lease of that part which he had  
pitched upon, and that Plough-  
share and Carrier should for the pre-  
sent be considered as members of  
Codline’s family. John had taken  
a great fancy to fishing, and thought  
he could wholly or chiefly subsist by  
it; but Humphry had a mind for a  
farm; so after a while they parted  
in friendship. Humphry, with a  
pack on his back and a spade in his  
hand, travelled across the Forest ‘till  
he found a wide meadow with a  
large brook ([^17]) running through it,  
which he supposed to be within  
John’s grant, and intended still to  
consider himself as a distant member  
of the family. But as it fell out  
otherwise, he was obliged to get a  
new lease, to which Mr. Frog made  
some objections, but they were over-  
ruled; and soon after another old  
fellow-servant, TOBIAS WHEATER,  
([^18]) came and sat down by him.  
They being so much alike in their  
views and dispositions, agreed to  
live together as intimates, though  
in two families, which they did ‘till  
Wheater’s death, when Plough-  
share became his sole heir, and the  
estate has ever since been his. This  
Humphry was always a very indus-  
trious, frugal, saving husband; and  
his wife, though a formal strait-  
laced sort of a body, yet always  
minded her spinning and knitting,  
and took excellent care of her  
dairy. She always clothed her  
children in homespun garments,  
and scarcely ever spent a farthing  
for outlandish trinkets. The fa-  
mily and all its concerns were  
under very exact regulations: not  
one of them was suffered to peep out  
of doors after the sun was set. It  
was never allowed to brew on Sa-  
turday, lest the beer should break  
the Fourth Commandment by work-  
ing on Sunday: and once it is said  
the stallion was impounded a  
whole week for having held *crim. *  
*con.* with the mare while the Old  
Gentleman was at his devotions.  
Bating these peculiarities, (and eve-  
ry body has some) Humphry was a  
very good sort of man, a kind neigh-  
bor, very thriving, and made a  
respectable figure, though he lived  
a retired life and did not much fol-  
low the fashions, yet he raised a  
good estate, and brought up a large  
family, who knew how to get their  
living wherever they could find land.

AFTER Ploughshare’s depar-  
ture, John Codline with his  
family kept on their fishing and  
planting, and sometimes went a  
hunting, so that they made out to  
get a tolerable subsistence. John’s  
family grew, and he settled his sons  
as fast as they became of age, to live  
by themselves; and when any of  
his old acquaintance came to see  
him, he bade them welcome, and  
was their very good friend, *as long *  
*as they continued to be of his mind*   
and no longer; for he was a very  
pragmatical sort of a fellow, and  
loved to have his own way in every  
thing. This was the cause of a  
quarrel between him and *Roger *  
*Carrier* ([^19]), for it happened that  
Roger had taken a fancy to dip his  
head into ([^20]) water, as the most  
effectual way of washing his face,  
and thought it could not be made so  
clean in any other way. John, who  
used the common way of taking  
water in his hand, to wash his face,  
was displeased with Roger’s innova-  
tion, and remonstrated against it.  
The remonstrance had no other ef-  
fect, than to fix Roger’s opinion  
more firmly, and as a farther im-  
provement on his new plan, he pre-  
tended that no person ought to have  
his face washed till he was capable  
of doing it himself, without any as-  
sistance from his parents. John was  
out of patience with this addition,  
and plumply told him, that if he  
did not reform his principles and  
practice, he would fine him, or flog  
him, or kick him out of doors. These  
threats put Roger on inventing  
other odd and whimsical opinions.  
He took offence at the letter X, and  
would have had it expunged from  
the alphabet. ([^21]) He would not  
do his duty at a military muster,  
because there was an X in the co-  
lours. After a while he began to  
scruple the lawfulness of bearing  
arms, and killing wild beasts. But,  
poor fellow! the worst of all was,  
that being seized with a shaking  
palsy ([^22]), which affected every limb  
and joint of him; his speech was so  
altered that he was unable to pro-  
nounce certain letters and syllables  
as he had been used to do. These  
oddities and defects rendered him  
more and more disagreeable to his  
old friend, who, however, kept his  
temper as well as he could, till one  
day, as John was saying a long grace  
over his meat, Roger kept his hat  
on the whole time. As soon as the  
ceremony was over, John took up a  
case knife from the table, and gave  
Roger a blow on the ear with the  
broad side of it, then with a rising  
stroke turned off his hat. Roger said  
nothing, but taking up his hat put  
it on again; at which John broke  
out into such a passionate speech as  
this “You impudent scoundrel! is  
it come to this! Have I not borne  
with your whims and fidgets these  
many years, and yet they grow up-  
on you? Have I not talked with  
you time after time, and proved to  
you as plain as the nose in your face  
that your notions are wrong? Have  
I not ordered you to leave them off,  
and warned you of the consequence,  
and yet you have gone on from bad  
to worse. You began with dipping  
your head into water, and would  
have all the family do the same, pre-  
tending there was no other way of  
washing the face. You would have  
had the children go dirty all their  
days, under pretence that they were  
not able to wash their own faces, and  
so they must have looked like the pigs  
till they were grown up. Then you  
would talk your own balderdash  
linguo, \[sic\] *thee and thou, and nan*—  
*forsooth*—and now you must keep  
your hat on when I am at my devo-  
tions, and I suppose would be glad  
to have the whole family do the  
same! There is no bearing with  
you any longer—so now—hear me,  
I give you fair warning, if you don’t  
mend your manners, and retract your  
errors, and promise reformation, I’ll  
kick you out of the house. I’d  
have no such refractory fellows here,  
I came into this forest for *reforma- *  
*tion*, and reformation I *will* have.”  
“Friend John (said Roger) dost  
not thou remember when thou and  
I lived together in friend Bull’s fa-  
mily, how hard thou didst think it  
to be compelled to look on thy book  
all the time that the hooded chap-  
lain was reading the prayers, and  
how many knocks and thumps thou  
and I had for offering to use our li-  
berty, which we thought we had a  
right to? Didst thou not come hi-  
therunto for the sake of enjoying  
thy liberty, and did not I come to  
enjoy mine? Wherefore then dost  
thou assume to deprive me of the  
right which thou claimest for thy-  
self?”  
“Don’t tell me (answered John)  
of right and of liberty—you have  
as much liberty as any man ought  
to have. You have liberty to do  
right, and no man ought to have  
liberty to do wrong.”  
“Who is to be judge (replied  
Roger) what is right or what is  
wrong? Ought not I to judge for  
myself? or thinkest thou it is thy  
place to judge for me?”  
“Who is to be judge (said John)  
why *the book* is to be judge—and I  
have proved by the book over and  
over again that you are wrong, and  
therefore you are wrong, and you  
have no liberty to do any thing but  
what is right.”  
“But friend John (said Roger)  
who is to judge whether thou hast  
proved my opinions or conduct to  
be wrong—thou or I? \[sic\]  
“Come, come, (said John) not so  
close neither—none of your idle dis-  
tinctions, I *say* you are in the wrong,  
I have *proved* it, and *you know* it,  
you have sinned against *your own *  
*conscience*, and therefore you deserve  
to be cut off as an incorrigible he-  
retic.”  
“How dost thou know (said  
Roger) that I have sinned against  
my own conscience? Canst thou  
search the heart?”  
At this John was so enraged that  
he gave him a smart kick on the  
posteriors, and bade him be gone out  
of his house, and off his lands, and  
called after him to tell him, that if  
ever he should catch him there again  
he would knock his brains out. Ro-  
ger having experienced that the lo-  
gic of the foot, applied to the breech  
is the most powerful of arguments,  
walked off; but had so much of hu-  
man nature left in him, as to turn up  
the folds of his coat, and expose the  
insulted part to view, which action,  
however expressive, has always been  
deemed no swearing, nor breach of  
the peace.—Thus they parted, and  
Roger having travelled as far as he  
supposed to be out of the limits of  
John’s lease, laid himself down by  
the side of a clear rivulet, which  
flowed down a hill; here he com-  
posed himself to sleep, and on his  
awaking found several bears about  
him, but none offered him any in-  
sult. Upon which he said, and mi-  
nuted it down in his pocket book,  
“Surely the beasts of the wilder-  
ness are in friendship with me, and  
this is designed by *Providence* ([^23]) as  
my resting place; here, therefore,  
will I pitch my tabernacle, and here  
shall I dwell more in peace, though  
surrounded by bears and wolves, than  
when in the midst of those whom I  
counted my brethren.”  
On this spot he built an hut, and  
having taken possession, made a visit  
to his old master Bull, who gave  
him a lease of the place, with an  
island or two in an adjoining cove of  
the great lake, and recommended  
to him a wife, by whom he had a  
few children; but his plantation was  
chiefly increased by the flocking of  
strangers to him; for he was a ve-  
ry hospitable man, and made it a  
rule in his family not to refuse any  
who should come, whether lame or  
blind, short or tall, whether they  
had two eyes or one, whether they s  
quinted or stammered, or limped, or  
had any other natural defect or im-  
pediment; it was another rule that  
every one should bear with the in-  
firmities of his neighbours, and help  
one another as they were able. I  
remember once as I was passing  
through Roger’s plantation I saw  
one man carrying another on his  
shoulders, which, at first, I thought  
a very odd sight; upon coming up  
to them, I perceived that the lower  
one was blind, and the upper one  
was lame, so as they had but one  
pair of eyes, and one pair of legs  
between them; the lame man avail-  
ed himself of the blind man’s legs,  
and he of the other’s eyes, and both  
went along very well together. I  
remember also, that as I passed along,  
the fences were in some places made  
of very crooked, knotty rails; but  
the crooks and knots were made to  
say \[sic\] into each other so cleverly, that  
the fences were as tight as if they  
had been made of stuff sawed ever so  
even; a circumstance which con-  
vinced me that very crooked things  
might be put together, to advan-  
tage, if proper pains were taken  
about it. This, however, was some  
time ago.—i have sine heard that  
the old crooks and knots and got  
out of order, and that they have not  
the art of making new ones say into  
one another so well as formerly.  
Whenever this happens it affords a  
kind of burlesque on the art of fence-  
making, but alas! how can it be  
otherwise when not but the lame  
and the blind are employed in the work?  
When John Codline had settled  
the controversy with Roger by kick-  
ing him out of doors, he began to  
look about him to see what his neigh-  
bours were doing. Having found a  
young fellow on his north-eastern  
limits, who had come thither with-  
out his knowledge or permission;  
he took it into his head to survey  
the extent of his grounds. The  
words of his lease were rather am-  
biguous, and by virtue thereof he  
thought it convenient to extend his  
claims over the lands on which *Ro- *  
*bert Lumber* (for that was the name  
of the young fellow) had settled.  
([^24]) It seems that Bob had been sent  
by some of John Bull’s family to  
erect a fishing stage on the borders  
of the Lake, and the lawyer who  
had the care of the forest not being  
acquainted so much as he ought to  
have been with the situation of the  
lands, or having no knowledge of the  
art of surveying, had made out a  
lease which lapped over Codline’s; so  
that each of them had a claim upon  
it. In some circumstances this might  
have been deemed unfortunate, but  
as it happened it proved lucky for  
poor Bob—his employers had left  
him in the lurch, and he would have  
starved to death if John had not  
taken him under his wing and sent  
him provisions to keep him alive.  
He also lent him a hand to clear up  
the bushes, and furnished him with  
materials to build a saw-mill. This  
set Bob on his own legs, and he  
proved a sturdy faithful fellow. He  
was of great service to John in kill-  
ing bears and wolves that infested  
his plantation; and when he himself  
was in danger, John lent him pow-  
der, shot, and flints, and sent hands  
to help him, and in so doing he serv-  
ed himself as well as his neighbour,  
which was no breach of morality.  
Thus they lived pretty peaceably to-  
gether, till after a while Bob’s old  
owners found the land was grown  
good for something, and then (with-  
out paying John for his assistance  
in making it so) appealed to Mr.  
Bull, and got it away, and took a  
large slice of John’s land into the  
bargain. ([^25]) This was a matter  
which stuck in John’s throat a great  
while, and if I am rightly informed  
he has hardly swallowed it yet.  
He did not think himself fairly dealt  
by though he had all Peregrine  
Pickle’s land put into a new lease  
which Bull gave him. To be short,  
John Codline and John Bull never  
heartily loved one another; they  
were in their temper and disposition  
too much alike; each was eternally  
jealous of the other: Business was,  
indeed, carried on pretty well be-  
tween them for many years, and had  
Mr Bull hearkened to the advice of  
his best friends, I suppose there  
would never have been any open  
quarrel between them.

The FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of* JOHN BULL, *the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from Page* 568.\]  
BETWEEN the lands occupied  
by Frederick Marygold, and  
those on which Humpry Plough-  
share had made his settlement, was  
a large tract of waste, where none  
of Mr. Bull’s family had ever been;  
but the report of the plantations  
which one and another of them had  
made, drew the attention of Bull’s  
neighbours. Among these, *Nicolas *  
*Frog* ([^26]) was not an idle spectator.  
He was as sly a fellow as you will  
meet with in a summer’s day, always  
attentive to his interest, and never  
let slip an opportunity to promote  
it. Observing that Mr. Bull was  
rather careless of the Forest, and trust-  
ed his lawyers and servants with the  
management of it, and knowing  
there was a large slice of it unoccu-  
pied, he clandestinely sent out some  
surveyors in the disguise of hunters,  
to make a description of the coun-  
try, and report to him at their re-  
turn. Another good neighbor  
GUSTAVUS, the ironmonger ([^27])  
was gaping after it, and gave out word  
among his journeymen, that if any  
of them would adventure thither  
and set up their trade, he would up-  
hold them in their pretensions, and  
lend them any assistance in his pow-  
er. Accordingly one of them, by the  
name of *Casimir*, ventured to make  
a beginning on the shore of a navi-  
gable creek; ([^28]) but did not care  
to penetrate far into the country,  
on account of the wolves and bears,  
which were very numerous thereabouts.  
As soon as Frog heard of this he  
picked a quarrel with Gustavus, and  
insisted that the land was his by  
possession, because he had already  
sent surveyors thither. It happened  
however, that the place which Frog’s  
people had pitched upon was at the  
mouth of another creek, ([^29]) at a  
considerable distance; where they  
had built a hut, on a point of land,  
and farther up the creek they had  
erected a kind of lodge or hunting-  
house, ([^30]) for the convenience of  
collecting game. On this planta-  
tion Frog had placed PETER STI-  
VER, a one-legged fellow, as his  
overseer. As soon as Peter heard  
of the quarrel between his master  
and Gustavus, he thought the quick-  
est way of ending it was the best;  
and therefore, without waiting for  
orders or ceremony, he went and  
commanded Casimir off the ground;  
and with one of his crutches beat  
his house to pieces about his ears.  
The poor fellow stared at this rough  
treatment; but was glad to escape  
with whole bones, and humbly re-  
quested leave to remain there with  
his tools, promising to follow his  
business quietly, and become an ob-  
edient servant to Mr. Frog; upon  
these conditions he was permitted  
to remain, and the whole tract was  
reputed Frog’s property.  
While these things were doing  
John Bull was confined to his house  
with a violent fever and delirium ([^31]),  
under which he laboured for a long  
time, and his imagination was the  
seat of every wild freak and strange  
vagary. One while he fancied  
himself an absolute monarch, then,  
a presbyterian clergyman, then a  
general of horse, then a lord-pro-  
tector; his noddle was filled with a  
jumble of polemic divinity, political  
disputes, and military arrangements,  
and it was not till after much blood-  
letting, blistering, vomiting and  
purging, that he began to mend.  
Under this severe, but wholesome  
regimen, he at length grew cool and  
came to himself, but found on his  
recovery that his affairs had gone  
behind-hand during his sickness.  
Beside the loss of business, he had  
physicians and apothecaries bills to  
pay, and those who had attended  
upon him as nurses, watchers, por-  
ters, &c. all expected wages or dou-  
ceurs, and were continually haunt-  
ing him with, How does your honour  
do? I am glad to see your honour so  
well as to be abroad. Some one or  
more were continually putting  
themselves in his way, and if they  
did not directly *dun* him for pay-  
ment, their looks were so signify-  
cant that a man of less penetration  
could easily have guessed what was  
their meaning.  
Bull was somewhat perplexed  
how to answer all their demands  
and expectations. He was too far  
behind-hand to be able to satisfy  
them, and withal too generous to  
let them remain unpaid. At length  
he hit on this expedient: “These  
fellows (said he to himself) have  
served me well, and may be of use  
to me again. There is yet a con-  
siderable part of my forest unoccu-  
pied. I’ll offer to lease them tracts  
of land which *cost me nothing*, and  
if they will accept them at a low  
rent, they may prove useful ser-  
vants, and I shall be a gainer as well  
as they.” Having come to this  
resolution, he began to enquire  
into the affairs of his forest, and found  
that his neighbours had intruded  
upon his claim. LEWIS had taken  
possession at one end ([^32]); Lord  
STRUT at the ([^33]) other; and NIC  
FROG in the middle ([^34]), and his  
own tenants had been quarrelling  
with their new neighbours, as well  
as among themselves. “Hey day,  
(says John) this will never do; I  
must keep a good look out upon  
these dogs, or they will get the ad-  
vantage of me.” Away he goes to  
Frog, and begun to complain of the  
ill treatment which he had received.  
Frog who had no mind either to  
quarrel, or to cry peccavi, like a  
sly, evasive whore-son as he was,  
shrugged up his shoulders, disowned  
what his servants had done, and said,  
he supposed they only meant to kill  
game, and did not intend to hold  
possession. Bull was not to be put  
off so; his blood was up and he de-  
termined to treat Frog’s servants  
as they had treated Casimir. So, cal-  
ling a trusty old stud out of his  
compting house, “Here Bob ([^35])  
(said he) take one of my servants  
with a couple of blood hounds, and  
go to that part of the forest where  
Peter Stiver has encroached, give  
him fair warning; tell him the land  
is mine, and I will have it; if he  
gives up at once, treat him well and  
tell him I’ll give him leave to re-  
main there; but if he offers to make  
any resistance, or hesitates about an  
answer, set your dogs at him and  
drive him off; kill his cattle and set  
his house on fire; never fear, I’ll  
bear you out in it.” Away goes  
Bob and delivered his message; Pe-  
ter at first thought it a matter of  
amusement, and begun to divert  
himself with it; but as soon as the  
dogs opened upon him he found his  
mistake, and rather than run the  
risk of being driven off, he quietly  
submitted to the conditions proposed.  
“Hang it (said he to himself)  
what care I who is my landlord?  
Gain is my object, I have already  
been at great expense, and have a  
prospect of getting an estate, to re-  
move will ruin me, I’ll therefore  
stay here, and make money under  
Bull, or Frog, or any other master  
that will let me stay.”  
In a subsequent quarrel which  
happened between Bull and Frog—  
the latter seized upon this planta-  
tion again, and Peter recognized  
his old master; but upon a com-  
promise it was given up to Bull in  
exchange for a tract of swamp ([^36])  
which lay far to the southward.  
Peter continued on the ground  
through all these changes, and follow-  
ed his business with great diligence,  
collecting game and pelts, and ven-  
ding them sometimes to Mr. Bull,  
and sometimes to Mr. Frog. How-  
ever, Bull thought it best that, in  
token of subjection, Stiver should  
change his name; to which he con-  
sented, and partly to please his new  
master, and partly to retain the re-  
membrance of his old one, he assum-  
ed the name of BULL FROG.  
The whole tract which was thus  
gotten from Frog, was thought too  
large for one plantation, and there-  
fore Mr. Bull, in pursuance of the  
plan which he had formed appro-  
priated the rents of the plantation,  
on which Bull Frog was seated to  
his brother, and the other part  
which had been taken from Casimir  
was leafed to two of his servants,  
CART-RUT and BARE-CLAY, and  
sometime after another tract was  
set off to WILLIAM BROADBRIM,  
whose father had been an assiduous  
rat-catcher in Mr. Bull’s family;  
but more of this hereafter.  
*Cart-rut* and *Bare-clay* agreed  
to divide their land into two farms,  
which they called the east and west  
farms; ([^37]) but when they came to  
run the division line, their compasses  
differed so much that they could  
not fix the boundary. This was  
one cause of dissention. Another  
was the different humors and dispo-  
sitions of their families. Those on  
the East farm were brought up un-  
der Mr. Bull’s sister PEG ([^38]); and  
as it is well known that she and her  
brother had long been at variance,  
so their domestics had got tinctured  
with the notions and prejudices of  
their respective families. The fa-  
mily on the West farm was made up  
of persons who were subject to the  
epidemic ague or shaking palsy ([^39]);  
with some stragglers from Bull-  
frog’s and Casimir’s families. From  
this diversity of constitutions and  
humours arose bickerings and quar-  
rels, a disinclination to work  
and submit to family government.  
These disorders continued a long  
while, and business went on very  
slowly, till at length the heads of  
both families agreed to give up their  
separate leases, and take a new one  
of the whole, and let Mr. Bull appoint  
an overseer. By these means peace  
was restored, and the new overseer,  
who was supposed to be a descen-  
dant of JULIUS CæSAR, gave the  
name of his ancestor to the farm,  
which has ever since been called Cæ-  
SAREA.  
There was another large portion  
of the forest, which lay southward  
of Walter Pipe-weed’s plantation,  
and which no person had yet taken  
up, though some had made attempts  
and had been driven off by the num-  
berless musquitoes and sand-flies,  
which abounded in those places.  
Mr. Bull was still desirous to re-  
ward his friends in the *cheapest man- *  
*ner*, and at the same time to keep  
his neighbors from encroaching  
upon him, and secure the possession  
of the forest to himself. In pursu-  
ance of his plan, and to make short  
work of it at once, he leased the  
whole of this southern extremity to  
CHARLES INDIGO, ([^40]) who was  
expressly ordered to take under his  
care and into his family all persons  
who had attended Mr. Bull, in his  
late sickness, in quality of nurses,  
druggists, apothecaries, laundresses,  
upholsters, porters, watchers, &c.  
&c. By this order Charles found  
himself at once surrounded by a large  
body of retainers of various ranks  
and qualities, and being a speculator  
himself, he employed a speculative  
man, Mr. *Padlock* (who had written  
a large treatise upon *Ideas*) to draw  
up some rules, for the management  
of such a family, intending when he  
should build an house, to paste it up  
in the parlour, as a directory to his  
wife. Accordingly Mr. Padlock  
went to work, and with an exquisite  
mixture of political and metaphysical  
knowledge, distinguished between  
the hall, the parlour, the dressing  
room, the gallery, the music-room,  
the bed-chambers, the chapel, the  
kitchen, the water-closet, &c. shew-  
ing what was to be done in each,  
and the proper subordination of one  
to the other, all which would have  
been of excellent service in a palace,  
and among people who had got to a  
high degree of refinement, but was  
ill suited to the circumstances of new  
adventurers in a forest. They rather  
needed to be instructed in the me-  
thod of felling trees, draining  
swamps, digging clams, guarding  
against musquitoes, killing wolves  
and bears, and erecting huts to keep  
off the weather. To these neces-  
sary affairs they were obliged to at-  
tend, and Mr. Padlock’s fine-spun  
rules were laid by and little thought of.  
Charles had pitched upon a sandy  
point, between two brooks for his  
mansion-house, and had made a small  
beginning when his repose was dis-  
turbed by one AUGUSTINE, ([^41]) a  
lubberly fellow, who had taken a  
lease of Lord STRUT, and lived  
farther southward. This Strut was  
the largest landholder in the coun-  
try, and was never satisfied with ad-  
ding field to field. He had already  
got much more than he could ma-  
nage, and had greatly impoverished  
his home-stead by attending to his  
extra-territories. His tenants were  
infected with the same land-fever,  
and wished to have no neighbors  
within sight or call. From this en-  
vious disposition Augustine collect-  
ed a rabble of lousy fellows, and  
was coming to dispossess Charles,  
thinking him too weak to make a  
defence; but Charles was a lad of  
too much *spunk* to be brow-beaten  
by such fellows. He armed all his  
people with some weapon or other,  
and advanced till he came within  
sight of the place where Augustine  
was, who on seeing him, took wit  
in his anger and went back, without  
attempting any mischief.  
Another difficulty which Charles  
expected to encounter was from the  
wild beasts; but luckily for him,  
these creatures got into a quarrel  
among themselves, and fought with  
each other till they had thinned  
their numbers considerably, so that  
Charles and his companions could  
venture into the woods, where they  
caught some few and tamed them,  
as was the usual practice among all  
Mr. Bull’s tenants at that day. Of this  
practice a more particular account  
shall be given, by way of digression.

\[5. October 1787\]  
The FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from page 622.*\]  
It must have been remarked by  
every person who has read the  
life and character of Mr. John Bull,  
that he was very whimsical, and as  
positive as he was whimsical. Among  
other advantages which he expect-  
ed from the settlement of his Forest,  
one was, that the wild animals  
whom nature had made ferocious and  
untractable in the highest degree,  
would be rendered tame and ser-  
viceable, by receiving instruction and  
education from the nurturing hand  
of humanity. He had conceived  
a notion that every creature has certain la-  
tent principles and qualities which  
form a foundation for improve-  
ment; and he thought it a great piece  
of injustice that these qualities should  
be suffered to remain uncultivated; he  
had a mind that experiments should be  
attempted to discover how far this  
kind of cultivation was practicable,  
and what use could be made of the  
animal powers under the direction  
and control of rational government.  
Full of this idea, he came to a reso-  
lation \[sic\], that it should be the duty of  
every one of his tenants to catch  
wild beasts of various sorts, and dis-  
cipline them so as to find out their  
several properties and capacities, and  
use them accordingly; and this kind  
of service was mentioned in their re-  
spective leases as one condition of  
the grants.  
Some of the tenants, particularly  
Peregrine Pickle, John Codline, and  
Humphry Ploughshare, entered zea-  
lously into the measure from princi-  
ple. They had, during Mr. Bull’s  
sickness and delirium, (before spoken  
of) formed an association for their  
mutual safety. ([^42]) The object of  
their union was two fold: first,  
to endeavour by all fair means to  
tame and discipline the wild beasts;  
and secondly, in case of their prov-  
ing refractory, to defend them-  
selves against their attacks. The  
other tenants did something in the  
same way; some from one principle,  
and some from another. Peter Bull-  
frog, who was as cunning as any of  
them, made use of those which he  
had tamed as his caterers, to pro-  
vide game for his table, of which  
the feathers and furs served him as  
articles of traffic, and brought him  
in a profitable return.  
The principal consideration (set-  
ting aside interest) which induced  
the more zealous of the Foresters  
to enter into this business, was an  
idea, that these animals were a de-  
generated part of the human spe-  
cies, and might be restored to their  
proper rank and order if due pains  
were taken. The grounds of this  
opinion were these: Among the tra-  
ditions of the ancient Druids there  
was a story, that out of *twelve* fa-  
milies which inhabited a certain dis-  
trict by themselves, *ten* had been  
lost, and no account could be given  
of them; and, where, said they, is it  
more likely to find them than in  
this forest, in the shape of some  
other creatures? especially, if the  
doctrine of transmigration, which  
the Druids held be true. Ano-  
ther tradition was, that one of Mr.  
Bull’s great great uncles, by the  
name of *Madok*, had many years  
ago disappeared, and the last ac-  
counts which had been received of  
him was, that he had been seen go-  
ing towards this forest; hence it  
was concluded that his descendants  
must be found there. In confirma-  
tion of this argument, it was al-  
leged, that the sounds which some  
of these creatures made in their  
howlings, resembled the language  
spoken in that day: nay, some were  
positive that they had heard them pro-  
nounce the word ([^43]) *Madokawando*;  
and one hunter roundly swore that  
he had seen in the den of a bear, an  
old *book* which he supposed to be a   
*Bible* written in the Celtic language,  
and this book they concluded must  
have been left there by Madok,  
who could read and speak no other  
language. Another very material  
circumstance was the discovery of a  
rock by the side of a brook, ([^44])   
inscribed with some characters which  
bore no resemblance to any kind of  
writing, ancient or modern; the  
conclusion from hence was, that it  
must be of the remotest antiquity:  
this rock was deemed an unaccount-  
able curiosity, till a certain virtuoso  
took into his noddle, first to ima-  
gine, and then to become extremely  
positive that the characters were *Pu- *  
*nic*; and finally this inscription was  
translated, and affirmed to be no-  
thing less than a treaty of alliance  
between the *Phenicians* and the first  
inhabitants of this forest. From  
all these premises it was inferred,  
with some plausibility, and more  
positiveness that one species at least  
of the savage animals was descended  
from *Madok*, and that the others  
were the posterity of the long lost   
*ten* families, who were well known  
to have had a commercial connec-  
tion with the *Phenicians*, and that  
these probably found out their haunt,  
and followed them for the sake of  
their former friendship. What hap-  
py light do modern discoveries and  
conjectures thrown on the dark pages  
of antiquity!  
From these principles, as well as from  
motives of humanity and of interest,  
some of the Foresters entered with  
zeal on the consideration and pract-  
ice of the best methods to fulfil this  
condition of their grants, the disci-  
plining the savage animals, and they  
certainly deserve praise for their ho-  
nest endeavours; but, others who  
pretended to the same zeal, it is to  
be lamented, made use of this pre-  
tence to cover their vanity or their  
avarice. Had none but gentle  
means been used, it is probable  
more good might, on the whole,  
have been produced; but as it often  
happens that many a good project  
has been ruined for want of pru-  
dence in the execution, so it fared  
with this; for while the new comers  
were busy in putting up their huts,  
and preparing the land for cultiva-  
tion, (both which were necessary  
before they could attend to any  
other business) some of the savage  
tribe would be a little impertinent,  
either by peeping into the huts, or  
breaking up a nest where the poul-  
try were hatching, or carrying off a  
chick or a gosling. These imperti-  
nencies bred frequent quarrels, and  
the poor creatures were sometimes  
driven off with bloody noses, or  
obliged to hop on three legs, or  
even laid sprawling and slyly cover-  
ed with earth, no service or ceremo-  
ny being said over the carcase, and  
no other epitaph than “Poh, they  
are nothing but brutes, and where’s  
the harm of killing them!” or in  
rhyme thus:\  
“Tit for tat, tit for tat,\  
“He stole my chick and I broke his back.”  
Whatever plausible excuses might  
have been made for these proceed-  
ings, they served to render the  
other creatures jealous of their new  
neighbors; but instead of abating  
their appetite for mischief, it sharp-  
ened their invention to take more  
sly methods of accomplishing it.  
The more wary of them kept aloof  
in the day time, and would not be  
enticed by the arts which were used  
to draw them in; however, they  
were sometimes pinched for food,  
and the new inhabitants used to  
throw crusts of bread, handfuls of corn,  
and other eatables, in  
their way, which allured them by  
degrees to familiarity. After a  
while it was found that nothing suc-  
ceeded so well as *melasses*: it was  
therefore thought a capital manoeu-  
vre to drop a train of it on the  
ground, which the creatures would  
follow, licking it, till they had in-  
sensibly got up to the doors of the  
houses, where, if any body held a  
bowl or a plate besmeared with the  
liquor, they would come and put  
their noses into it, and then you  
might pat them on the back  
and sides, or stroke them, say-  
ing, “poor Bruin, poor Isgrim,  
poor Reynard, poor Puss,” and the  
like, and they should suffer them-  
selves to be handled and fondled till  
they dropped asleep. When they  
awaked they would make a moan  
and wag their tails as if they were  
asking for more, and if it was de-  
nied them, they would retire to the  
woods in disgust, till the scent of  
the melasses operating on their de-  
praved appetites, invited them to  
return where it was to be had. This  
was upon repeated trial found to be  
the most effectual way of taming  
them, as they might be taught to  
imitate any kind of tricks and ges-  
tures if a dish of melasses was held  
out as a reward.  
The Foresters knew that they  
could not ingratiate themselves bet-  
ter with their old master Bull, than  
by humouring his itch for pro-  
jects. They therefore took care to  
raise reports and write letters from  
time to time concerning the won-  
derful success which they had met  
with in civilizing the savage animals.  
Bull was greatly pleased with these  
reports, and made a practice of send-  
ing presents of trinkets to be dis-  
tributed among them; such as col-  
lars, ear-rings, and nose-jewels. Se-  
veral times some of the most stately  
and best instructed of them were car-  
ried to his house for a show, where  
he had them dressed up in scarlet  
and gold trappings, and led through  
all his apartments for the entertain-  
ment of his family, and feasted with  
every nick-nack which his cook  
and confectioner could procure.  
He was so fond of being thought  
their patron and protector, that he  
usually spoke of them as his *red *  
*children*, from the colour of their  
hides. It is not many years since  
one of them, after being led through  
several families and plantations of  
the tenants, was carried home to  
Mr. Bull’s own house, dressed in  
the habit of a *clergyman*, having  
been previously taught to lift his  
paw and roll his eyes as if in the act  
of devotion. This trick was so well  
carried on that the managers of it  
picked up a large pocket full of  
pence, by exhibiting him for a raree-  
show, and the money was applied  
toward building a *menagerie*, where  
beasts of all kinds might be brought  
and tamed. This project, like ma-  
ny such whims, has proved of more  
profit to the projectors, than bene-  
fit to the public; for most of those  
who were supposed to be tamed and  
domesticated, after they had been  
sent back to their native woods  
with a view to their being instru-  
mental in taming their fellow-sa-  
vages, have returned to their former  
ferocious habits, and some of them  
have proved greater rogues than  
ever, and have done more mischief  
than they could otherwise have been  
capable of.  
Mr. Bull himself was once so full  
of the project, that he got his chap-  
lain and some others to form them-  
selves into a club ([^45]), the professed  
object of which was to propagate  
knowledge among these savage crea-  
tures. After some trials which did  
not answer expectation, old madam  
Bull conceived that the money which  
was collected might as well be ex-  
pended in teaching Mr. Bull’s own  
tenants themselves a little better  
manners; for some of them were ra-  
ther awkward and slovenly in their  
deportment, while others were de-  
cent and devout *in their own way*.  
Madam, as we have before obser-  
ved, was a great zealot in the cause  
of *uniformity*, and had a vast influ-  
ence over her son, by virtue of which  
the attention of the club was prin-  
cipally directed to the promoting  
this grand object. Accordingly,  
every one of the tenants was fur-  
nished with a bible and a prayer-  
book, a clean napkin, bason, platter  
and chalice, with a few devotional  
tracts, and some young adventurers  
who had been educated in the fami-  
ly, were recommended as chaplains;  
who had also by-orders to keep a  
look out toward the savage animals,  
when they should fall in their way.  
The chaplains were tolerably well  
received in most of the families;  
but some, particularly Codline and  
Ploughshare, who gloried in being  
able to say *without book*, always  
looked sour upon them, and would  
frequently say to them, “Go, take  
care of the savage objects of your  
mission, and don’t come here to  
teach us, ‘till you have learned bet-  
ter yourselves.” The chaplains in  
disgust, and perhaps in revenge (for  
they were but men of like passions)  
would pout and swell and call *schis- *  
*matic* and other canonical nick-  
names, of which there is extant a  
large vocabulary, and would fre-  
quently write letters, much to the  
disadvantage of their opponents. It  
is not many years since they, with  
the club which sent them, were pret-  
ty severely handled by one of Cod-  
line’s own Chaplains, and it is sup-  
posed that they have ever since been  
abating their arrogance; certain it  
is that they are on better terms *now*   
with their neighbors than ever;  
this may, in part, be owing to some  
other circumstances, but be the cause  
what it may, it is looked upon by  
the judicious, as one of the most  
hopeful among the signs of the times.

The FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from page 710.*\]  
It has been observed, that the  
lease which Mr. Bull gave to   
*Charles Indigo*, obliged him to re-  
ceive into his family all such persons  
as had been attendants on Mr. Bull  
during his sickness, and for whom  
he had no other means of provid-  
ing. This general indulgence pro-  
cured to Charles the reputation of  
a very friendly, hospitable person,  
and induced great numbers of other  
people of various characters, views,  
and interests, to seek an assylum  
within his limits. About this time  
old Lewis had grown sick and pee-  
vish, and had severely cudgelled  
some of his apprentices, because they  
did not make their P’s and Q’s ex-  
actly to his mind ([^46]). The poor  
fellows, to prevent worse treatment,  
fled from his house, and took refuge  
with Mr. Bull, who treated them  
civilly, and recommended them  
to the Forest, where they dispersed  
in the several families of his tenants,  
and a large party of them took up  
their abode with Charles, to whose  
family they proved an industrious,  
profitable acquisition, though some  
of the family looked a little sourly upon them.  
This facility of admitting strangers  
produced an effect which had almost  
proved fatal to the reputation of the  
family; for a number of highway-  
men ([^47]) also sought shelter there,  
and by means of their gold and sil-  
ver, which they had in plenty, made  
friends in the house, and were ad-  
mitted by night at a back door.  
After a while they grew more bold  
and came in the day time, under  
the disguise of pedlars, with packs  
on their shoulders. One of them  
actually took his stand behind a cor-  
ner of one of the fences, from  
whence he sallied out on travellers;  
this corner obtained, from that cir-  
cumstance, the name of *Point-Fear*,  
and as the first names of places are  
not easily got rid of, it retains the  
name to this day, and perhaps will  
ever retain it. Here the rascal in-  
tended to have built himself a lodge,  
and taken up his quarters for life;  
but the matter was now grown so  
public, that Charles, for the honour  
of his family, ordered all stragglers  
to be seized, and this fellow in par-  
ticular, after a severe struggle, was  
apprehended and brought to justice.  
The same spot was afterward tak-  
en possession of by *Peter Pitch*, ([^48])   
a poor fellow who got his living as  
he did his name, from collecting the  
resinous juice of the numerous pines  
which grew thereabouts. He had  
to work hard and fare hard, and go  
a great way for his victuals and  
clothes; but after he had lived alone  
for some time, he picked up one  
or two acquaintances of his own stamp,  
and they formed a family which was  
at first rather disorderly. Farther  
discovery of the lands, and the ad-  
vantage of the water-carriage, in-  
duced some other people to sit down  
by him, and in process of time he  
became so respectable as to be no-  
ticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he  
never gave him a lease in form, yet  
let him have cloth and haberdashery  
upon credit, and took his pitch in  
payment as fast as he could collect  
it. This kept him in a dependent  
state, and subjected him to impo-  
sitions from Bull’s clerks and jour-  
neymen. It is not many years since  
Bull sent him a taylor to *try-on* a  
new coat, ([^49]) which was so strait  
that it split in several places, and  
never could be altered so as to fit  
him, but he was obliged to wear it  
rather than quarrel with his patron.  
This same taylor was remarkable for   
*cabbaging*, as Peter Bull-Frog and  
Humphry Ploughshare have since had  
large experience.  
To finish what relates to Charles  
Indigo, we shall observe, that the  
land on which he began his planta-  
tion, was in general so wet and miry,  
that it was unfavourable to the pro-  
duction of wheat, and it was for  
some time doubtful whether he  
would be able to raise his own bread.  
Chance at length effected what la-  
bour and ingenuity could not: a  
bird of passage having dropped some  
kernels of rice in his dung it was  
found to thrive exceedingly well;  
from whence the hint was taken,  
and rice became the standard grain  
of the plantation. By the cultiva-  
tion of this, and of a weed which  
was useful to the dyers; he grew  
rich, and made a sightly figure  
among his neighbours in point of  
dress and equipage, though his  
countenance is rather sallow, and  
he is subject to frequent returns of  
the intermittent fever.  
By the extensive lease given to In-  
digo and his associates, most of Mr.  
Bull’s dependants and attendants  
were provided for, and their services  
recompensed with a shew of gene-  
rosity on his part, and of satisfac-  
tion on theirs. We have before just  
hinted at a grant made to *William *  
*Broad Brim* ([^50]), of which we shall  
give a more particular account.  
His father had been an old ser-  
vant of Mr. Bull, and had been em-  
ployed in the very laborious and ne-  
cessary business of catching and  
killing rats. In this employment  
he was so very dexterous and suc-  
cessful that he recommended him-  
self highly to his master, who not  
only allowed him large wages  
but promised him farther recompense.  
During Mr. Bull’s sickness, the  
care and diligence of this faithful  
servant had been unremitted and his  
merits were thereby increased, so  
that Mr. Bull on his recovery found  
himself deeply indebted to him, and  
he still continued his services; till,  
worn out with age and infirmity,  
he died and had an honorable fu-  
neral.  
His son William then became his  
heir, and solicited for payment of  
the arrears due to his father, which  
Mr. Bull, according to the maxim  
he had laid down for himself, and  
urged by the necessity of the occa-  
sion, proposed to discharge by a  
lease of part of the Forest. This  
happened to fall in, exactly, with  
William’s views, which were of a  
singular nature.  
About this time a nervous dis-  
order appeared in Bull’s family  
which went by the name of the  
([^51]) *shaking palsy*. We shall not  
pretend to trace the causes of it,  
as the origin of such things is often  
obscure and impenetrable; but the  
effects were, a trembling of the  
nerves, a stiffness in the neck and  
shoulders, and a hesitancy in the  
speech, so that it was impossible  
for the patients to pronounce cer-  
tain words and syllables, such as  
Sir, Madam, your honor, my lord,  
&c. nor could one of them raise his  
hand to take off his hat, or hold it  
up when an oath was to be admi-  
nistered.  
Mr. Bull’s choleric temper misin-  
terpreted this natural infirmity into  
a sullen disrespect. When he found  
a change in the behaviour of these  
domestics; that instead of bowing to  
him they stood upright as a May-  
pole, and instead of sir, and your ho-  
nor, they could utter nothing but   
*Friend*, he grew angry, and made a  
pretty free use of his fist, and when  
he found that they could not be  
cured by such means, he thrust some  
of them into a dark closet, and shut  
them up till they should (as he  
termed it) “learn better manners;”  
and it is supposed he would have car-  
ried his resentment much further,  
but for this circumstance; William  
Broadbrim, who had himself strong  
symptoms of the disorder, whispered  
to Mr. Bull, that if he would give  
him time to ripen a project, which  
he had conceived, he would rid him  
of all trouble with these people.  
William had a plodding genius, and  
the scheme with which his head was  
pregnant at this time, was nothing  
more or less than to make a settle-  
ment in the forest, and take all these  
people with him. Bull, who was  
glad to get rid of them, and of the  
debt which he owed to William,  
readily fell in with the project; and  
a grant was made out under hand  
and seal, wherein William Broad-  
brim, and his heirs, were invested  
with the right of soil, and all other  
privileges of proprietorship, in a cer-  
tain part of the forest, between the  
plantation of Frederic Marygold,  
and that of Cart-rut and Bare-clay,  
being in the neighborhood of the  
spot where Casimir had rebuilt his  
hut, and lived in an ambiguous situ-  
ation, not knowing who was his  
landlord. With him William made  
a peaceable compromise, saying,  
“Friend, I will do thee no violence,  
there is room enough for us both.”  
Casimir was glad of so good a neigh-  
bor, and he had reason to be, for  
he throve more rapidly after this  
than before.  
William pitched upon a level  
piece of ground, where two large  
brooks met, for the situation of his  
mansion-house, and went to work to  
draw up rules for the government  
of his family. One of which was,  
that no person should be refused  
admittance into it, or disturbed  
in it, or cast out of it, on ac-  
count of any natural infirmity.  
Another was, that no arms, nor  
ammunition, should ever be made  
use of on any pretence whatever.  
The first of these rules gained Wil-  
liam great reputation among all sen-  
sible men; the latter was a notion  
which candor would lead us to sup-  
pose proceeded partly from the dis-  
order of his nerves, and partly from  
a love of peace, and the exercise of  
good will toward his fellow crea-  
tures.  
When any of William’s neigh-  
bors, who were of a different way  
of thinking, spake to him of the im-  
policy of this rule, and asked him how  
he expected to defend himself and his  
family against the wild beasts, if  
they should attack him; William,  
(who was fond of harangue) would  
answer thus—“There is in all crea-  
tures a certain instinct, which dis-  
poseth them to peace. This instinct  
is so strong and fixed, that upon it,  
as upon a foundation, may be erect-  
ed a complete system of love and  
concord, which all the powers of  
anarchy shall not be able to over-  
throw. To cultivate and improve  
this instinct is the business of every  
wise man, and he may reasonably  
expect that an example of this kind,  
if steadily and regularly adhered to,  
will have a very extensive and bene-  
ficial influence, on all sorts of crea-  
tures; even the wild beasts of the fo-  
rest will become tame as the lambs,  
and birds of prey as harmless as  
doves. Dost thou not see, friend,  
what influence my example has al-  
ready had on those creatures which  
are deemed savage? I go into their  
dens with safety, and they enter my  
habitation without fear. When  
they are hungry I feed them, when  
they are thirsty I give them drink,  
and they in return bear my burdens,  
and do such other kind offices  
as they are capable of, and I require of  
them. I have even tamed some of  
them so far, that they have sold me  
the land on which they live, and  
have acknowledged the bargain by  
a mark made with their toe-nails on  
parchment. They are certainly  
some of the best natured creatures  
in the world; their native instinct  
leads them to love and peace, and  
sociability, and as long as I set  
them a good example I have no  
doubt they will follow it. When  
such is my opinion and expectation,  
why should I be anxious about what  
may, and I trust never will happen?  
Why should I put myself in a pos-  
ture of defence against those who  
will never attack me? or, why  
should I by the appearance of jea-  
lousy and distrust on my part, of-  
fend those who now put confidence  
in me? No, No, I will not suppose  
that they will ever hurt me. I will  
not suffer the *carnal weapon* to be  
seen in my house, nor shall one of  
my family ever learn the detestable  
practice of pulling the trigger. I  
leave the instruments of destruction  
to the offspring of Cain and the seed  
of the serpent; while I meekly imi-  
tate the gentleness of the lamb, and  
the innocence of the dove.”  
With such harangues William  
would frequently entertain himself  
and his friends, and he was so san-  
guine in his benevolent project, that  
instead of having his own name (as was  
usual) written over his door, he had  
the words BROTHERLY LOVE, trans-  
lated into a foreign language, and  
inscribed in golden characters, as  
a standing invitation to persons  
of all nations and characters to  
come and take shelter under his  
roof.

The FORESTERS:\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from page 741.*\]  
The general invitation which  
William Broadbrim had gi-  
ven to all persons who were desti-  
tute of a home, to come and take  
shelter under his roof, and the gen-  
tle humane treatment which those  
who accepted the invitation met  
with, spread his fame abroad,  
and brought him much company. His  
family was sometimes compared to  
the Ark of Noah, because there  
was scarcely any kind of human  
being, of whatever shape, size, com-  
plexion, disposition, language or  
religion, but what might be found  
there. He had also the art to keep  
them pretty well employed. Indu-  
stry, frugality, and œconomy, were  
the leading principles of his family,  
and their thriving was in a ratio  
compounded of these three forces.  
Nothing was wanting to make them  
as happy a family as any in the  
world, but a disposition among  
themselves, to live in peace. Un-  
luckily, however, this desirable  
blessing, on account of the variety  
of their humours and interests, was  
seldom found among them. Am-  
bition, jealousy, avarice, and party  
spirit, had frequent out-breakings,  
and were with difficulty quelled. It  
is needless to enter into a very par-  
ticular discussion of the grounds or  
effects of these dissentions: family-  
quarrels are not very entertaining  
either at home or abroad, unless to  
such as delight in scandal, and it is  
presumed the readers of this narra-  
tive are not of that number. But  
there was one cause of dissention  
which it would be improper not to  
notice, because we have already  
hinted at the principle from which  
it proceeded. William’s aversion  
to fire arms was so strong, that he  
would not suffer any of his family  
to molest the wild inhabitants of  
the forest, though they were ever  
so mischievous. While the family  
was small, the savage animals who  
lived in the neighborhood being  
well fed, were tolerably tame and  
civil, but when the encreased num-  
ber of the family had penetrated  
farther into the forest, the haunts of  
the natives were disturbed and the  
straggling labourers were sometimes  
surprised, and having nothing to  
defend themselves with, fell a sa-  
crifice to savage resentment. Re-  
monstrances were presented to Mr.  
Broadbrim one after another, but  
he always insisted on it that the suf-  
ferer must have been the aggressor,  
and that “they who take the  
sword must expect to perish by the  
sword.” At length the dead corpse  
of one of the labourers, mangled  
and torn in a dreadful manner, was  
brought and laid at the door of  
William’s parlour ([^52]) with a label  
affixed to the breast, on which were  
written these words, “Thou thy-  
self must be accounted my murder-  
er, because thou didst deny me the  
means of defence.” At sight of  
this horrid spectacle, Broadbrim  
turned pale! The eye of his mind  
looked inward! Nature began to  
plead her own cause within him!  
he gave way in some degree to her  
operations, though contrary to his  
pre-conceived opinion, and with a  
trembling hand signed a permission  
for those to use the ([^53]) *carnal wea- *  
*pon*, who could do it without scru-  
ple; and when they asked him for  
money to buy guns, powder and  
ball, he gave them a certain sum to  
provide *the necessaries of life*, leav-  
ing them to put their own construc-  
tion on the words. By degrees  
his squeamishness grew less public,  
and though it is imagined he has  
still some remainder of it, yet ne-  
cessity has so often overcome it  
that there is not much said on the  
subject, unless it be very privately  
and among *friends*.  
During the time of which we  
have been speaking Mr. John Bull  
had undergone another sickness ([^54]),  
not so long nor so violent as the  
former but much more beneficial in  
its effects. His new physicians had  
administered medicines which com-  
posed his nerves, he eat, drank  
and slept more regularly, and conversed  
more frequently with his wife ([^55])  
than heretofore. By these means  
his vigour was renewed, but still  
his whimsical disposition remained,  
and broke out on several occasions.  
When he viewed his extensive for-  
est, now planted and thriving, un-  
der the honest hand of industry, he  
thought within himself that still  
greater advantages might be derived  
from that territory. There was  
yet a part of it unsettled between  
the plantation of Charles Indigo,  
and the dominions of Lord Strut;  
and Bull thought it a pity to let so  
much remain a wilderness. The  
other plantations had been made by  
discontented servants and needy ad-  
venturers who struggling with hard-  
ships, by a steady perseverance had  
surmounted many difficulties, and  
obtained a comfortable living.  
“Now (said Bull) if these fellows  
have done so well, and got so far  
aforehand, without having any ca-  
pital of their own to begin with,  
what cannot be done by the force  
of my great capital? If they have  
performed such wonders, what great-  
er wonders may be brought into  
view by my own exertions, with all  
the advantages which it is in my  
power to command? To it, boys,  
I vow I’ll have a farm of my own  
that shall beat you all!”—Having  
conceived this project, his brains  
immediately became pregnant with  
ideas; but according to the rule  
which he had lately prescribed to  
himself he communicated the matter  
to his wife. This good lady, though  
prudent, was not free from a ro-  
mantic turn of mind. She was ex-  
tremely fond of having it thought  
that she had great influence over her  
husband, and would sometimes gra-  
tify his humour at the expense of her  
own judgment, rather than not  
keep up this idea. His expectations  
from his new project were very san-  
guine. The land on which he had  
cast his eye was enough for a large  
farm; it had a southern exposure,  
it was warm, rich and fertile in some  
parts, and in others boggy or sandy.  
He had conversed with some fo-  
reigners, who told him that it was  
proper for the cultivation of wine  
and silk, and he imagined that if  
he could but add these articles to  
the list of his own productions, there  
would be a great saving in the fa-  
mily. Mrs. Bull too was pleased  
with the idea of having her silk  
gowns and ribbands of her own  
growth, and with the expectation of  
having the vaults filled with wine,  
made on her own plantation; for  
these and other good reasons, her  
thereunto moving, madam gave her  
consent to the project. The person  
appointed to carry it into execution  
was *George Trusty*, ([^56]) a sensible  
well-bred merchant, but one who  
had only speculated in the science  
of agriculture, and knew nothing  
of it by experience. Having col-  
lected a number of poor people who  
were out of employment, he sent  
them to the spot, with strict orders  
to work fix days in seven, to keep  
their tools free from rust, and their  
fire-arms in readiness for their de-  
fence; whatever they should earn  
was to be their own as long as they  
lived, and after their death their  
possessions were to descend to their  
*sons*, and in default of male issue  
to revert to the original grantor.  
They were not allowed to use black  
cattle in the labour of the field;  
and were expressly forbidden to  
drink grog. Their business  
was to cultivate vines and mulberry  
trees, and to manufacture wine and  
silk. Upon this project another  
was grafted by the very sagacious  
*Doctor Squintum*, who chose this  
new plantation as the most conve-  
nient spot in the world for a charity  
school, where *Orphans* might re-  
ceive the best education and be fit-  
ted to be the pillars of church and  
state.  
But notwithstanding the sums  
which Bull so freely lavished out  
of his bags for the support of the vine  
and mulberry plantations; and not-  
withstanding the collections which  
Squintum made among his nume-  
rous devotees, these projects were  
either so impracticable in them-  
selves, or so ill conducted in the ex-  
ecution, that neither of them answer-  
ed the expectations of the project-  
ors. For want of black cattle the  
soil could not be properly tilled,  
and for want of grog the labourers  
fainted at their work; the right of  
inheritance being limited to the  
male line, women and girls were  
not fond of living there, and the  
men could not well live without  
them; land, cattle, women and  
grog, were to be had elsewhere,  
and who would be confined to such  
a place? The land too, was claimed  
by Lord Strut, who sent them  
writs of ejectment. The Charity-  
School dwindled to nothing and  
was consumed by fire. Poor George  
Trusty was discouraged and begged  
Mr. Bull to take the plantation in-  
to his own hands, however Bull  
kept supplying him with cash and  
he kept making attempts. Altera-  
tions were made in the terms of  
settlement, the restrictions were re-  
moved, cattle and grog were al-  
lowed, Lord Strut was ousted  
and possession held; the swamps  
were drained; rice and indigo were  
cultivated instead of silk and wine,  
and upon the whole, considerable im-  
provements were made, though at  
such a vast expense that Mr. Bull  
never saw any adequate returns.  
The ill-success of this adventure,  
did not deter him from another pro-  
ject. He was extremely fond of   
*Trout* ([^57]) and thought if he could  
have them regularly catched and  
brought to his table, he should ex-  
ceed all his neighbours in delicate  
living, and now and then be able to  
send a mess to his particular friends.  
Lord Peter’s family too, he thought  
would be glad to buy them as they  
were very useful in the long lents,  
and frequent meagre days observed by  
them. There was a part of the  
forest on the north-east quarter,  
which was very conveniently situa-  
ted for this employment. ([^58]) It  
had been occupied by *Alexander *  
*Scotus*, a purblind fellow, who had  
straggled thither no one could  
tell how, and it was matter of  
doubt whether he derived his right  
from Bull or Lewis, for both of  
them laid claim to the land, and  
their claims had not been fairly  
decided in law. To make sure of  
the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of  
his wife, sent thither ([^59]) a parcel of  
naked half starved people, who could  
live no where else, and supported  
them for several years with provisi-  
ons, furnished them with skiffs,  
lines, hooks and other implements  
to carry on the fishery; but every  
trout which they catched, cost him  
ten times as much as if he had  
bought it in the common market;  
nor could he after all get half of  
what he wanted for his own con-  
sumption. His trout-fishery, and  
his mulberry plantation, rendered  
him the laughing-stock of his neigh-  
bours, nor could he ever gain even  
the interest of the money he had  
laid out upon them; while the fo-  
resters who had settled at their own  
expense grew rich and became res-  
pectable. He had indeed, the be-  
nefit of their trade, which kept his  
journeymen at work, and obliged  
him to enlarge their number; for  
the foresters had a respect for their  
old master and landlord, and when  
they had any thing to sell they al-  
ways let him have the refusal of it,  
and bought all their goods of him.  
But though he called himself their  
father, and his wife their mother,  
yet it is thought he never entertain-  
ed a proper parental affection for  
them; but rather looked on them  
with a jealous eye, as if they were  
aiming to deprive him of his claim  
and set up for independence. Had  
he been contented with the profits  
of their trade, as was certainly his  
interest, they might have remained  
his tenants to this day; but ambi-  
tion, avarice, jealousy and choler,  
inflamed by bad counsellors, have  
wrought such a separation, that it  
is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning  
all the remainder of his days, and  
his grey hairs will be brought down  
with sorrow to the grave.

The FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from* vol. i. *page* 793.\]  
In the preceding part of this his-  
tory we have endeavoured, to trace  
the several steps by which the forest be-  
came cultivated and peopled. Mr.  
Bull had no less than fourteen tenants  
who held under him, and were settled  
on lands which he claimed as his own,  
and which he had granted to them in  
separate parcels. Their names were as  
follows, beginning at the north-east, and  
proceeding to the south-west:  
Alexander Scotus, N. S.\  
Robert Lumber, N. H.\  
John Codline, M.\  
Roger Carrier, R. I.\  
Humphrey Plough-share, C.\  
Peter Bull-Frog, N. Y.\  
Julius Caesar, N. J.\  
—— Casimir, D.\  
William Broad-brim, P.\  
Frederick Mary-gold, M.\  
Walter Pipe-weed, V.\  
Peter Pitch, N. C.\  
Charles Indigo, S. C.\  
George Trusty, G.  
It was observed, that of all the ad-  
venturers, those generally were the  
*least thriving*, who received *most assist- *  
*ance* from their old master. Whether  
it was owing to their being employed  
in business to which they had not serv-  
ed a regular apprentice-ship, or to a  
natural indolence, and a disposition to  
continue hangers-on where they had  
got a good hold; for it must be noted,  
that Mr. Bull was very generous to  
some persons, and on some occasions  
where it suited his fancy, and this dis-  
position in him was so prevalent, that  
they who kenned him, and would hu-  
mor his whims, could work him out  
of any thing which they had a mind  
to \[sic\]  
On the other hand, those adventu-  
rers who came into the forest on their  
own hook, and had no assistance at all  
from their old master, nor any thing to  
help themselves with, but their own  
heads and hands, proved to be the most  
industrious and thriving, and after a  
while told up a good estate. They all  
seemed to have an affection for Mr.  
Bull, and it was generally believed  
to be sincere. His house was usually  
spoken of by them as their *home*.  
His ware-house was the center of their  
traffic; and he had the address to en-  
gross the profits of their labour and  
draw their earnings into his own fob.  
To some of them he would now and  
then make a present, to others he would  
lend a ([^60]) pack of his hounds when he  
was out of the humor of hunting;  
but they were generally useless to  
them for the purpose of scouring the  
woods, those who could afford it kept  
dogs of their own, who were better  
trained to the game, and could better  
scent the forest, being native curs, and  
not so spruce and delicate a breed as  
Bull’s grey-hounds.  
It has been before observed, that  
each end of the forest was occupied  
by Bull’s rivals. His old neighbour  
Lewis had got the north end, and  
Lord Strut the south. Bull’s tenants had  
seated themselves chiefly on or near  
the shore of the lake, and had not ex-  
tended very far back, because of the  
beasts of prey; but Lewis, like a cun-  
ning old fox, had formed a scheme to get  
footing in the interior parts of the  
country, and prevent these planters  
from penetrating beyond the limits  
which he intended to assign them. His  
emissaries had been sent slyly into the  
distant parts of the forest, under pre-  
tence of taming these beasts of prey;  
but in fact they had halved the matter  
with them, and had themselves become  
as savage as the beasts had become  
tame. They would run, leap and  
climb with them and crawl into their  
dens, imparting to them a lick of *me- *  
*lasses* out of their calabash, and teaching  
them to scratch with their paws the  
sign of a cross. They had built several  
hunting lodges on the most convenient  
passes of the brooks and ponds,  
and though thus scattered in the wood,  
were all united under one overseer,  
called ([^61]) *Onontio*, who lived in the  
mansion-house of *St. Lewis*’s Hall.  
It was matter of wonder among  
Bull’s tenants, for some time, what  
could be the reason that the wild beasts  
had grown more surly and snappish  
of late than formerly; but after a  
while, some hunters made a discovery  
of the new lodges, which the emissa-  
ries of Onontio had erected, and the  
design of them being apparent, a gene-  
ral alarm was raised in the plantations.  
On the first news, Walter Pipe-weed  
sent his grandson ([^62]) *George*, a smart,  
active, lively youth, across the hills,  
with his compliments to the intruders,  
desiring them to move off, and threat-  
ening them with a writ in case of non-  
compliance. This modest warning be-  
ing ineffectual, it was thought that if  
an *Union* could be formed among the  
tenants, they might make a stand a-  
gainst these encroachments. A meet-  
ing was held at ([^63]) *Orange-Hall*, but  
no efficient plan could be hit on, with-  
out a previous application to their land-  
lord, who hearing of this meeting,  
conceived a jealousy with regard to this  
*union* which seemed to be their object,  
and thought it was better to retain the  
management of the matter in his own  
hands, and keep them divided among  
themselves, but united in their depend-  
ence on him. He therefore sent them  
word that “he had a very great affect-  
“ tion for them, and would take care  
“ of *their* interest, which was also *his *  
“ *own*; that he would not suffer old  
“ Lewis to set his half-tamed wild  
“ beasts upon them, nor eject them  
“ from their possessions, but that he  
“ would immediately take advice of  
“ his council, learned in the law, con-  
“ juring them by the affection which  
“ they professed to bear towards him,  
“ to be aiding and assisting in all ways,  
“ in their power towards bringing the  
“ controversy to an issue.”  
At this time, the Steward, to whom  
Mr. Bull entrusted the care of his bus-  
iness, was not a person of that discern-  
ment and expedition which the exigen-  
cy of affairs required. He had com-  
mitted divers blunders in his accounts,  
and it was suspected that he was a de-  
faulter in more respects than one. It  
cannot, therefore, be expected, that in  
conducting a controversy of this mag-  
nitude, he should exactly hit on the  
right methods, nor employ the best  
council which could be had. The  
first step which was taken was to send   
([^64]) *Broad-oak* the bailiff, with a writ  
of intrusion which he was ordered to  
serve *volens nolens* upon one of the  
messuages or hunting-seats of Lewis.  
This bailiff proceeding rashly and a-  
gainst the best advice into the forest,  
not a step of which he was acquainted  
with, found his progress impeded in a  
way wholly unexpected. For Onontio  
had taken care to place a number of  
his half tamed wild cats and wolverenes  
on the boughs of trees, which hung  
over the path, and as soon as the bailiff  
came within reach, having first wetted  
their tails with their own urine, they  
whisked it into his eyes till they blind-  
ed him. This manoeuvre put a stop to  
the process for that time.  
Several other attempts of the like  
kind were made without success, and  
Lewis at one time had almost got pos-  
session of ([^65]) *Orange-Hall*. Not only  
the foresters themselves, but even  
Bull’s own domestics, complained bitter-  
ly of these ineffectual measures, and  
their clamors at last prevailed to  
make him discharge his old steward,  
and put another into his place. The  
new ([^66]) officer soon changed the face  
of affairs; he employed no attorneys,  
nor bailiffs, but those of tried and ap-  
proved abilities, men of enterprize and  
resolution, by whom the suit was pro-  
secuted in good earnest. In every ac-  
tion Bull recovered judgment, and got  
possession. When Lord Strut came in  
to the aid of Lewis, Bull cast him also,  
and took away his manor of Augustine,  
which with the whole tract of land,  
where Onontio presided, was annexed  
to his estate. The agents who had  
been employed in this arduous service,  
were not only well paid for doing their  
duty, but, with the steward, who em-  
ployed them, were honored according  
to the ancient, but whimsical custom of  
Bull’s family, by having their effigies  
portrayed on sign-boards, pocket-  
handkerchiefs, snuff-boxes, and punch-  
bowls; so that while the fit lasted, you  
could not walk the streets, nor blow  
your nose, nor take a pinch of snuff,  
nor a draught of punch, but you were  
obliged to *salute* them.  
Whenever Bull’s steward called up-  
on the foresters for their quotas of aid,  
towards carrying on this heavy law-  
suit, they always readily afforded it;  
and some of them were really almost  
exhausted by the efforts which they  
made, to do *more* than their share. The  
steward was so sensible of their merit,  
that on due consultation with Mr.  
Bull’s wife, and her taking him in the  
right mood, he was prevailed upon to  
reimburse the extra expense to them,  
and mutual complacency reigned be-  
tween the landlord and tenants all the  
time this steward remained in office.  
But these times were too good to last  
long; there were some who envied  
him his reputation, and raised stories  
to his disadvantage, which highly af-  
fronted him. At this time Mr.  
Bull was so much off his guard, as to give  
heed to these reports, and take a rash  
step in a hurry, which he had occasion  
to repent of at his leisure. He accept-  
ed the resignation of this trusty ser-  
vant, and put one of his ([^67]) sister  
Peg’s cast-off footmen into his place;  
whereby he laid a foundation for his  
own disgrace, and the dismemberment  
of his estate, as the reader will see  
in the following pages of this history.  
\[*To be continued*.\]  
\[9. April 1788\]  
The FORESTERS,\  
*An* AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the  
Clothier.*  
\[*Continued from page* 60.\]  
TO trace with precision all the  
causes, great and small, which  
operated to the dismemberment of  
John Bull’s estate, would be no  
easy task; some of them perhaps,  
were *secret*, but of such, as were open  
to observation, we shall endeavour  
to sketch out the principal.  
It is well known, that he was of a  
choleric habit, and that those who  
were acquainted with his humour and  
passions, could manage and impose  
upon him at their pleasure. Had  
he been let alone to pursue his own  
business *himself*, his plain, natural  
good sense, and generosity of mind,  
would have kept him clear of many  
difficulties; but he had his advisers,  
his hangers-on, his levee-hunters,  
his toad-eaters, and sycophants, for-  
ever about him, who, like a parcel  
of blood-suckers, could never have  
enough to glut their voracity.  
When the forest was first occupied  
by the tenants, Bull had a ([^68]) wife  
who minded her own domestic busi-  
ness, and did not concern herself  
with his landed interest. The  
leases and grants were made out in   
*his* name, and he was supposed to  
be the owner or proprietor; but  
the lady whom he now had, was very  
assuming, and insisted on having  
her hand in the management of *all *  
his affairs. She visited the compt-  
ing-house, and made the clerks  
shew her their books; she over-  
haled the steward’s accounts,  
and inspected his correspondence;  
she not only looked after the rents  
and incomes of the forest, but even  
intruded into the household concerns  
of the tenants, and affected to call  
herself *their mother*, because she had  
taken some care of one or two of  
them in their first setting out, al-  
though most of them scarcely ever  
had seen her face, or had any ac-  
quaintance with her, but by hearsay.  
It must be observed, also, that  
this woman had engaged Mr. Bull  
in some expensive lawsuits, and  
speculations, which had got him  
deeply into *debt*, and he was obliged  
to hire money of usurers to carry  
her schemes into execution. Had  
she, at the same time, introduced that  
frugality and economy into the fa-  
mily, which her duty ought to have  
prompted her to, this debt might  
have been kept down, and the in-  
terest regularly paid; but the swarm  
of harpies which were continually  
about her, and the course of gamb-  
ling which was carried on under her  
connivance and direction, swallowed  
up all the profits of the trade, and  
incomes of the land, while the lux-  
ury and dissipation of the family in-  
creased in proportion, as the means  
of discharging the debt decreased.  
In short, Mr. Bull was reduced to  
that humiliating condition, which,  
by whatever fashionable name it may  
now go, was formerly called *petti- *  
*coat-government*.  
During the law-suit with Lewis  
and Lord Strut ([^69]) concerning the  
forest, there had been a great inter-  
course with the tenants. Many of  
Bull’s servants and retainers, who  
were employed as bailiffs and attor-  
nies, and their deputies, had been  
very conversant with them, and  
were entertained at their houses,  
where they always found whol-  
esome victuals, jolly fire sides, and  
warm beds. They took much no-  
tice of every thing that passed, ask-  
ed many questions, and made many  
remarks on the goodness of the  
land, the pleasant situation of the  
houses, the clean and thriving con-  
dition of the children, who were al-  
ways ready to wait them, to  
clean their boots, hold their stir-  
rups, open and shut the gates for  
them, and the like little necessary  
services, as well bred children in the  
country are wont. The remarks  
which these persons made, when  
they got home, favored rather of  
envy, than of gratitude or affection.  
Some of them would say “Those  
fellows live too well in the forest;  
they thrive too fast; the place is  
too good for them; they ought to  
know who is their master; they  
can afford to pay more rent;  
they ought to pay for the help they  
have had; if it had not been for  
Master Bull, and the assistance which  
he has lent them, they would have  
been turned out of doors; and now  
they are to reap the benefit of his  
exertions, while he (poor man) is  
to pay the cost.”  
There were not wanting some, in  
the families of the Foresters them-  
selves, who had the meanness to  
crouch to these fellows, and suppli-  
cate their favour and interest with  
Mr. Bull, to recommend them to  
some posts of profit, as under-stew-  
ards, collectors of rent, clerks of  
receipts, and the like pretty offices.  
These beggarly curs would repeat  
the same language, and hold corres-  
pondence with the bailiffs, attornies,  
&c. after they had got home.  
Whenever any trifling quarrel hap-  
pened in the families of the tenants,  
they would magnify it and fill their  
letters with complaints of the licen-  
tiousness of the people, and plead  
for a tighter hand to be held over  
them.  
Such speeches as those were fre-  
quently made, and such letters read,  
in the hearing of Mr. Bull’s wife  
and steward. This grew by degrees  
to be the current language of the  
family, and Bull himself listened to  
it. His choler rose upon the occa-  
sion, and when his hangers-on ob-  
served it, they plied him with strong-  
er doses, till his jealousy and hatred  
were excited, and a complete revo-  
lution in his temper, with regard  
to his tenants, took place, agreea-  
bly to the most sanguine and male-  
volent wishes of his and their ene-  
mies.  
The first effect of this change  
was, that his clerks were ordered  
to charge not only the prices of the  
goods, which the tenants should  
purchase, but to make them pay  
for the *paper* ([^70]) on which their  
bills of parcels and notes of hand  
were written, and that at a very  
exorbitant rate. This was so into-  
lerable an abuse, and withal so mean,  
pitiful, and beggarly an expedient  
to pick their pockets, that they  
held a meeting among themselves,  
and resolved not to buy any more  
of his goods, as long as this impo-  
sition lasted; and by way of con-  
tempt, they hanged and burned the  
effigies of the steward, and other  
persons who were suspected of hav-  
ing advised to these new measures.  
The resentment shewn by the te-  
nants on this occasion was quite un-  
expected. The secret favourers, and  
real authors of the mischief, began  
to be afraid that they had gone too  
far for the first attempt. Bull’s  
journeymen were in an uproar about  
it, left by the failure of his trade  
they should be out of bread; and  
to shorten the story, he was obliged  
to give up the point of making  
them pay for the paper, though   
*Madam* had the singular modesty to  
make a declaration, that it was a  
mere matter of *expediency*, and that  
SHE had the sole power and right  
of dominion over them, notwith-  
standing Mr. Bull’s *most gracious *  
concession at that time. ([^71])  
This was considered by the te-  
nants as a most impudent and bare-  
faced assumption; for whatever  
rights Mr. Bull might pretend to  
have, as their old master and land-  
lord, yet they never had any idea  
of a *mistress* over them; and though  
they very complaisantly returned  
him their thanks for his present  
goodness, yet as they suspected  
that there was more mischief hatch-  
ing, they began to enquire more  
narrowly than ever into his right  
and title to the land, on which they  
lived. They looked over old parch-  
ments and memorandums, consulted  
council learned in the law, and after  
due deliberation, they were fully  
convinced, that *their own* title was,  
at least, as good as his, and that  
they had a right to refuse him any  
rent or acknowledgment, if it were  
prudent for them to exercise it.  
Mr . Bull’s jealousy was now en-  
creased with regard to their intenti-  
ons, and his scribbling retainers  
frequently accused them of ingrate-  
tude and disobedience, and a long pre-  
meditated design to set up for inde-  
pendence; a thing which they had  
not yet thought of, and probably  
never would, if this abusive treat-  
ment had not put it into their heads.  
But though by those means they  
were led into an enquiry, and a train  
of thinking, which were quite new  
to them; yet as old habits are not  
easily broken, and their affection for  
their master was very strong, they  
endeavoured, with a candor which  
did them honor, to transfer the  
blame from him to his wife and  
steward, to whose machinations they  
knew he was a dupe. These bad  
counsellors soon renewed their at-  
tempts in another shape, by raising  
the rent, and putting an advanced  
price upon the goods, and by means  
of additional clerks, packers, por-  
ters, watchmen, draymen, &c. who  
were continually in waiting, and  
to all of whom fees were to be paid,  
the trade laboured under great em-  
barrassments, and some of the Fo-  
resters were quite discouraged, others  
were vexed and impatient, while  
some of the better tempered of them,  
endeavoured to persuade the rest to  
keep up the communication as long  
as they could. They were loth to  
quarrel with their old master, and  
yet could not pocket the affronts  
and abuses to which they were daily  
exposed.  
During this sullen interval, many  
letters passed, many books and pre-  
cedents were examined, and much  
ink was shed, in a controversy,  
which, however incapable of a *deci- *  
*sion* in this way, might have been  
*compromised*, if Mr. Bull’s first  
thoughts had been as good as his  
second; but he was so completely  
under management, as not to see  
his true interest. It was a common  
saying among his neighbors, “John  
Bull’s wit comes afterward;” and  
in fact it did not come in this case,  
till too late, for, when a cause once  
gets into the law, there are so many  
quirks, evasions, demurs, and procras-  
tinations, that it is impossible to  
make a retreat, till one or both of  
the parties have severely smarted  
for their temerity.
